# ðŸ’§ No Sense Crying Over Spilt Formulas: Excel Loan Schedule Demo

This Excel demo showcases how to use **dynamic array formulas and the spill feature** in Microsoft Excel to build a flexible loan amortization schedule using:

- `SEQUENCE()` to generate payment periods
- `PPMT()` to calculate the **principal** portion of each payment
- `IPMT()` to calculate the **interest** portion of each payment

|------|------------------------|
| A2   | Number of Payments     |
| C2   | Loan Amount            |
